+ Add options to select when swapping occur in img2img (before/after generation or both) 
+ Add a model selection (not very useful since it seems insightface has no plans to release further swapping models.)

0.0.2 : Reduce det_size in swapper when face is not found. Should improve results when face is too big.

0.0.1 : first release
